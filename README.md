## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with yasm on Gitpod, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Notes & caveats

If you need to target, emulate or develop for other CPU archiectures then install [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) which works on Gitpod out of the box ðŸ§¡
